            <p>There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America - there's the United States of America. But as Americans, we also know that this is a nation of laws, and we cannot have those laws broken when more than 2,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems - two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate change; problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all. He does not say health care or the economy. These are not opinions to be debated; these are facts to be dealt with.</p>
            <p> Ironically, this quintessentially American - and yes, conservative - notion of self-help found frequent expression in Reverend Wright's sermons. They have killed people of different faiths - more than any other, they have killed Muslims. <br><br>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America</p>
